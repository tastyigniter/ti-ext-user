## Introduction

The TastyIgniter user extension is a fundamental part of the TastyIgniter platform, providing comprehensive user management capabilities. It allows administrators to manage front-end users (customers) and staff members, handle authentication, registration, password reset, email verification, and user impersonation.

## Features

- **User Management:** Manage front-end users (customers) and staff members.
- **Authentication:** Handle user authentication.
- **Registration:** Handle customer registration with optional email verification.
- **Password Reset:** Provide users with the ability to reset their passwords.
- **User Impersonation:** Allow administrators to impersonate customers or other staff members for troubleshooting.
- **Automation Events & Conditions:** Provide automation events for customer registration and conditions for customer attributes.

## Installation

You can install the extension via composer using the following command:

```bash
composer require tastyigniter/ti-ext-user:"^4.0" -W
```

Run the database migrations to create the required tables:
  
```bash
php artisan igniter:up
```

## Getting started

### Registration settings

You can configure the registration settings in the admin area. Navigate to the _Manage > Settings > Customer registration_ admin settings page. Here you can enable/disable customer registration, and where to send registration emails to the customer email and/or location email.

### Managing customers

To manage customers, navigate to the _Customers_ admin page. Here you can view a list of all registered customers, search for customers, view customer details, and manage customer accounts.

### Managing staff members

To manage staff members, navigate to the _Manage > Staff members_ admin page. Here you can view a list of all registered staff members, search for staff members, view staff member details, and manage staff member accounts.

## Usage

### Authenticating customers

To authenticate a customer, you can use the `\Igniter\User\Facades\Auth` facade. The `attempt` method accepts an array of credentials and a boolean value to indicate if the user should be remembered.

```php
use Igniter\User\Facades\Auth;

$credentials = [
    'email' => 'email@domain.tld',
    'password' => 'password',
];

Auth::attempt($credentials, $remember);
```

The `Auth::check` method can be used to check if a user is authenticated.

```php
if (Auth::check()) {
    // The user is authenticated
}
```

The `Auth::logout` method can be used to log out a user.

```php
Auth::logout();
```

#### Using the `LoginUser` action class

For a streamlined approach to authenticating customers in TastyIgniter, you can utilize the `\Igniter\User\Actions\LoginUser` action class. This class mirrors the authentication process used by the default login form. It also dispatches two key events — `igniter.user.beforeAuthenticate` and `igniter.user.login` — which can be used to hook into the login process for custom behavior or integrations.

```php
use Igniter\User\Actions\LoginUser;

$loginUser = new LoginUser($credentials, $remember);
$loginUser->handle();
```

### Authenticating staff members

To authenticate a staff member, you can use the `\Igniter\User\Facades\AdminAuth` class. The `attempt` method accepts an array of credentials and a boolean value to indicate if the user should be remembered.

```php
use Igniter\User\Facades\AdminAuth;

$credentials = [
    'email' => 'admin@domain.tld',
    'password' => 'password',
];

AdminAuth::attempt($credentials, $remember);
```

The `AdminAuth::check` method can be used to check if a staff member is authenticated.

```php
if (AdminAuth::check()) {
    // The staff member is authenticated
}
```

The `AdminAuth::logout` method can be used to log out a staff member.

```php
AdminAuth::logout();
```

### Customer registration

To register a customer, you can use the `\Igniter\User\Facades\Auth` facade. The `register` method accepts an array of customer data and a boolean value to indicate if the customer should be activated. The method returns the created customer model.

```php
use Igniter\User\Facades\Auth;

$customerData = [
    'first_name' => 'John',
    'last_name' => 'Doe',
    'email' => 'email@domain.tld',
    'password' => 'password',
];

Auth::register($customerData);
```

### Creating a staff member

To create a staff member, you can use the `\Igniter\User\Facades\AdminAuth::register` method. The `register` method accepts an array of staff member data and a boolean value to indicate if the staff member should be activated. The method returns the created staff member model.

```php
use Igniter\User\Facades\AdminAuth;

$staffData = [
    'name' => 'John Doe',
    'username' => 'johndoe',
    'email' => 'admin@domain.tld',
    'password' => 'password',
];

AdminAuth::register($staffData);
```

#### Using the `RegisterUser` action class

For a streamlined approach to registering customers in TastyIgniter, you can utilize the `\Igniter\User\Actions\RegisterUser` action class. This class mirrors the registration process used by the default registration form. It also dispatches two key events — `igniter.user.beforeRegister` and `igniter.user.register` — which can be used to hook into the registration process for custom behavior or integrations.

```php
use Igniter\User\Actions\RegisterUser;

$data = [
    'first_name' => 'John',
    'last_name' => 'Doe',
    'email' => 'email@domain.tld',
    'password' => 'password',
];

$registerUser = new RegisterUser();
$customer = $registerUser->handle($data);

if ($customer->is_activated) {
    // Registration successful
    $customer->mailSendRegistered(['account_login_link' => page_url('account.login')]);
} else {
    // Registration requires email verification
    $customer->mailSendEmailVerification([
        'account_activation_link' => page_url('account.register').'?code='.$customer->getActivationCode(),
    ]);
}
```

The `activate` method can be used to activate a customer account.

```php
use Igniter\User\Actions\RegisterUser;

$registerUser = new RegisterUser();
$registerUser->activate();

$registerUser->sendRegisteredMail(['account_login_link' => page_url('account.login')]);
```

### Resetting customer passwords

To reset a customer's password, you can use the `resetPassword` method on the `\Igniter\User\Models\Customer` model. The method returns the reset password code.

```php
use Igniter\User\Models\Customer;

$customer = Customer::where('email', 'email@domain.tld')->first();
$resetCode = $customer->resetPassword();
```

Using the `mailSendResetPasswordRequest` method, you can send a password reset email to the customer.

```php
$customer->mailSendResetPasswordRequest([
    'reset_link' => page_url('account.reset', ['code' => $resetCode]),
]);
```

To complete the password reset process, you can use the `completeResetPassword` method on the `\Igniter\User\Models\Customer` model. The method accepts the reset password code and the new password.

```php
$customer = Customer::where('email', 'email@domain.tld')->first();
$customer->completeResetPassword($resetCode, 'newpassword');
```

Using the `mailSendResetPassword` method, you can send a password changed email to the customer.

```php
$customer->mailSendResetPassword([
    'account_login_link' => page_url('account.login'),
]);
```

### Resetting staff member passwords

To reset a staff member's password, you can use the `resetPassword` method on the `\Igniter\User\Models\User` model. The method returns the reset password code.

```php
use Igniter\User\Models\User;

$user = User::where('email', 'admin@domain.tld')->first();
$resetCode = $user->resetPassword();
```

Using the `mailSendResetPasswordRequest` method, you can send a password reset email to the staff member.

```php
$user->mailSendResetPasswordRequest([
    'reset_link' => admin_url('login', ['code' => $resetCode]),
]);
```

To complete the password reset process, you can use the `completeResetPassword` method on the `\Igniter\User\Models\User` model. The method accepts the reset password code and the new password.

```php
$user = User::where('email', 'admin@domain.tld')->first();
$user->completeResetPassword($resetCode, 'newpassword');
```

Using the `mailSendResetPassword` method, you can send a password changed email to the staff member.

```php
$user->mailSendResetPassword([
    'login_link' => admin_url('login'),
]);
```

#### Using the `igniter:passwd` command

You can also reset a staff member's password using the `igniter:passwd` Artisan command. The command accepts the staff's email address and the new password.

```bash
php artisan igniter:passwd 'admin@domain.tld' 'password'
```

### Impersonating customers

To impersonate a customer, you can use the `impersonate` method on the `\Igniter\User\Facades\Auth` facade. The method accepts the customer model.

```php
use Igniter\User\Facades\Auth;
use Igniter\User\Models\Customer;

$customer = Customer::find(1);
Auth::impersonate($customer);
```

Using the `stopImpersonate` method, you can stop impersonating the customer.

```php
Auth::stopImpersonate();
```

### Impersonating staff members

To impersonate a staff member, you can use the `impersonate` method on the `\Igniter\User\Facades\AdminAuth` facade. The method accepts the staff member model.

```php
use Igniter\User\Facades\AdminAuth;
use Igniter\User\Models\User;

$user = User::find(1);
AdminAuth::impersonate($user);
```

Using the `stopImpersonate` method, you can stop impersonating the staff member.

```php
AdminAuth::stopImpersonate();
```

### Authorising access to admin pages

To authorise access to admin pages, you can use the `hasPermission` method on the `\Igniter\User\Models\User` model. The method accepts the permission code.

```php
use Igniter\User\Models\User;

$user = User::find(1);
if ($user->hasPermission('Admin.Orders')) {
    // User has permission to access the admin orders page
}
```

You can also use the `hasAnyPermission` method to check if a user has any of the specified permissions.

```php
if ($user->hasAnyPermission(['Admin.Orders', 'Admin.Reservations'])) {
    // User has permission to access the admin orders or reservations page
}
```

Use the `requiredPermissions` property on [admin controller classes](https://tastyigniter.com/docs/extend/controllers) to specify the permissions required to access the controller actions.

```php
class Orders extends \Admin\Classes\AdminController
{
    public $requiredPermissions = ['Admin.Orders'];
}
```
